[Beagle](http://www.beaglesense.com) is a range of smart, wireless, non-intrusive sensors that you can place throughout your home or office. Each Beagle is a specialized device that monitors one of

- Air Quality
- Temperature
- Outdoor Noise
- Indoor Noise
- Air Pressure
- Humidity
- Light

The data collected by the sensors is transmitted over a private wireless network to a local base station at which point it is securely communicated to Beagle's Cloud Service.

Our goal is to enable customers to learn about and improve the health of their indoor environments through insights gained from the data.

Beagle is pleased to provide a public API to unleash the creative energy of the development community. The API can be broadly divided into two functional categories:  

- Accessing the physical Beagles installed in your home or office network.  
- Accessing the data collected by your Beagles and stored in the Beagle Cloud.

Let us know what great creations you build with our API!
